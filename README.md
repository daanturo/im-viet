Rules for the Vietnamese input methods [VNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNI) (and additionally Telex for comparison purpose).

Producing rules was done by parsing words from the [Hunspell-vi](https://github.com/1ec5/hunspell-vi) dictionary and written to `generated-im-vni.json`, `generated-im-telex.json`.


For Android [Florisboard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard) users, import `florish-im-vni-extension.flex` to type with VNI.
